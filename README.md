# static-prosborne
NextJS version of my website.

## What is this for?
Beyond being the personal site for me, the purpose of this project is to create a POC of developing NextJS static pages with Prism and GraphQL. In my search for a templateable way of trying out ideas, as well as a way to manage all of my side projects in a single technology stack, I am giving this a try!
